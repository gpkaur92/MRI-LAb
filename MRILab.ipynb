    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an imaging test that uses powerful magnetic forces, radiofrequency (RF) waves and a computer to make detailed 3-dimensional pictures of the organs, bones and tissues inside your body.MRI is based on a physics phenomenon discovered in the 1930s, called nuclear magnetic resonance or NMR, in which magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to give off tiny radio signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases MRI can be done if you have joint replacements, artificial heart valves, implanted ports for drugs, implanted nerve stimulators or metal pins, screws, plates, stents or staples. Tooth fillings and braces are not often affected by the magnetic field, but they may distort images of the face or brain.\n",
    "\n",
    "MRI is noisy with loud knocking or clanging sounds that you can hear during the scan. An MRI is a painless test.\n",
    "\n",
    "An MRI may be done to:\n",
    "\n",
    ". Assess different parts of the body and figure out if you have certain diseases.\n",
    ". Diagnose cancer and figure out the stage (how far the cancer has spread).\n",
    ". Help plan cancer treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The medical use of magnetic resonance imaging has developed rapidly. The first MRI equipment in health was available at the beginning of the 1980s. In 2002, approximately 22 000 MRI cameras were in use worldwide, and more than 60 million MRI examinations were performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water constitutes about two-thirds of the human body weight, and this high water content explains why magnetic resonance imaging has become widely applicable to medicine. There are differences in water content among tissues and organs. In many diseases, the pathological process results in changes of the water content, and this is reflected in the MR image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Water is a molecule composed of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The nuclei of the hydrogen atoms are able to act as microscopic compass needles. When the body is exposed to a strong magnetic field, the nuclei of the hydrogen atoms are directed into order – stand \"at attention\". When submitted to pulses of radio waves, the energy content of the nuclei changes. After the pulse, a resonance wave is emitted when the nuclei return to their previous state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The small differences in the oscillations of the nuclei are detected. By advanced computer processing, it is possible to build up a three-dimensional image that reflects the chemical structure of the tissue, including differences in the water content and in movements of the water molecules. This results in a very detailed image of tissues and organs in the investigated area of the body.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method**\n",
    "\n",
    "During the MRI:\n",
    "\n",
    "You will lie on a movable exam table. Straps and pillows may be used to help you stay in the correct position and hold still during the exam.\n",
    "For an MRI of the head, a device is positioned around the head to hold it in place. \n",
    "Devices that contain coils may be placed around or near the area being scanned. These coils help improve the image quality of areas such as the neck, shoulder, knee or breast.\n",
    "The table slides into a narrow cylinder that houses the MRI scanning magnet. The inside of the scanner is well lit and has a fan that gently blows fresh air. The part of your body being examined is positioned in the centre of the cylinder. The surface of the cylinder may be just a few inches from your face.\n",
    "You may be offered ear plugs or ear phones so you can listen to music during the scan.\n",
    "You will need to lie still inside the MRI machine while it takes pictures. Usually MRI scans include multiple sequences of pictures. Some sequences last for several minutes.\n",
    "You may be asked to hold your breath at times to help get a clearer picture[2].\n",
    "\n",
    "*Procedure followed during MRI lab:*\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects on which Scan was done: Watermelon,Tomato and Corn.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We put all of the above on the table that slides in a scanning magnetic cylinder.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We positioned the center of all the objects put in there.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then the scan was started by pushing the on button.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other side Team 3 was doing the scan and collecting the pictures of it. Scan was done from both horizontal aand vertical sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "General results that are forseen from an MRI are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A change in the shape, size or structure of tissues or organs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A mass that could be a tumour (an MRI cannot always tell the difference between a cancerous tumour and a non-cancerous tumour).\n",
    "\n",
    "> A tumour’s approximate shape, size and location.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Spread of a cancer within the body (metastasis).\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the tumour has gotten smaller, stayed the same or grown after treatment[3].\n",
    "\n",
    "But the objective for which we performed the experiment was different. Since, we were there to study the way of performing it and what is the equipment required as well as the way to acquire the signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the results according to our point of view were as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> This process is very effective in acquiring signals from body and then for diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The time required is bit more for the scan and person should be standstill to get better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since, We could acquire lot many images from all angles so better in diagnosis of artefact or disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*_Few Precautions to be taken before entering the MRI scan room were that we shouldnot be wearing any metal accessory and also no mobile phones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discussion**\n",
    "\n",
    "During our Lab we had a problem that the center of object changed after a while and then we have to do it with manual positioning on the computer to take the slices.In between the experiment we positioned the object again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Playing with code for running the LAB Notebook was pretty easy.\n",
    " \n",
    "Before performing the experiment in Lab Professor told us about all the probes that are in use in MRI scans. Few of them are:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Head scanner probe- used for scanning brain and head.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Circular scaaning probes- this pair of probes is used for scanning any part of body but this both are to be placed opposite to each other around the part under examination.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cylindrical Full Body scanner- This is a big scanning magnet. A person is carried in this cylinder and scanning is done for whole body. the cylinder is having many coils performing as magnet.\n"
